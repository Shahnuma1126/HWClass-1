 <p>Fiverr’s latest campaign, called "Team Up," celebrates freelancers as an extension of your team.‍
 </p>
 <p>With so much change in the air, an increasing number of companies are flexing their in-house teams with freelance talent to increase their adaptability, productivity and manage scalability.  93% of a recent Deloitte and MIT Sloane  Management survey’s participants consider external contributors (including freelancers) an integral part of their workforce. 91% say their organization supports managers looking to hire external workers. And finding the perfect match has never been easier. 

 </p>
 <p>The hardest part? You might miss them once they finish the job.

 </p>
 <p>But what do these independent workers look like? "Team Up" brings a freelancer and their temporary business team together. It’s Fiverr’s first campaign that puts a larger focus on medium to large-sized businesses, showing how they can incorporate freelancers into their teams to successfully tackle any initiative.
